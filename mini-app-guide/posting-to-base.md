# Posting to Base

After you unlock a caption, photo, or video, you have two fast ways to publish.

### Option 1: Copy and paste

Use this when you want manual control.

* Tap **Copy**.
* Switch to the Base post composer.
* Paste the caption.
* Attach media if needed.

If you generated media from the caption screen, attach that asset here.

### Option 2: Post directly (deep-link)

Use this when you want speed.

* Tap **Post to Base**.
* The Base app opens the composer.
* The unlocked caption is pre-filled.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only unlocked content should be inserted into the composer. Never deep-link with locked content.
{% endhint %}

### What happens to credits

Credits are deducted only at **unlock** time. Posting does not consume extra credits.
