# Caption Generation (Hook Reveal)

Captions use a **blind hook selection** flow. You preview hooks first. You spend credits only to reveal the final caption.

### Flow

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Choose caption intent

Pick what you want to post. Examples:

* Product update
* Launch announcement
* Thread opener
* Meme / culture post
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Generate hook options (preview-only)

The AI generates multiple **hooks**. A hook is the first line. It’s capped at **\~120 characters**.

You can scroll and compare hooks freely. No credits are spent here.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select 1 hook to reveal the full caption

Tap a hook to unlock the full caption.

* The caption is revealed immediately.
* Your balance is reduced by **1 credit**.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use the caption (and generate media)

After reveal, you can:

* **Copy** the caption.
* **Post to Base** (deep-link or compose flow).

You also get two media actions on this screen:

* **Generate image**
* **Generate video**

These use the revealed caption as the default context.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Why we hide the full caption first

It keeps the selection focused on **hook quality**. It also aligns cost with actual value. You pay only when you commit to one option.

### Credit rules recap

* Hook previews: **free**.
* Revealing a full caption: **-1 credit**.
* Tapping **Generate image**: **-1 credit**.
* Tapping **Generate video**: **-1 credit**.
