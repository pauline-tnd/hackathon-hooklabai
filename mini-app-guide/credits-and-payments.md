# Credits & Payments

HookLab uses a simple **credit** model. There’s **no subscription**.

### Free credits

* New wallets start with **5 free credits**.
* Free credits are meant for the first session.

### When credits are spent

Credits are spent when you **unlock** a final output.

* Viewing **hook previews**: **free**.
* Generating a list of **hook options**: **free**.
* Revealing a **full caption**: **-1 credit**.
* Tapping **Generate image**: **-1 credit**.
* Tapping **Generate video**: **-1 credit**.

Photo and video are generated from the **revealed caption** screen. You tap **Generate image** or **Generate video**.

### Buying credits

When your balance hits **0**, the app prompts you to purchase credits.

* You pay only when you choose to unlock a result.
* Each unlock is a one-time charge.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If a payment fails or is rejected, credits must **not** be deducted. You should stay on the preview screen.
{% endhint %}

### Refunds and retries (product rule)

* If unlock fails after payment, the app should either:
  * auto-retry the reveal, or
  * restore the credit.

Keep this behavior consistent. It avoids “paid but didn’t receive” cases.
