# FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Why can I only see hooks first?

To keep you focused on the first line. The first line drives most engagement.

### Do I spend credits by generating hooks?

No. Hook previews are free. You spend **1 credit** only when you reveal a full caption.

### Do I spend credits by generating an image or video?

Yes. Each click generates **one** result. Each generation costs **1 credit**.

### I revealed a caption but the credit didn’t change

Refresh your balance. If it still looks wrong, re-open the mini app.

### I paid but didn’t get the result

This should not happen. The app should either retry the reveal or restore the credit.

### Can I re-open an unlocked result without paying again?

Yes. Unlocked outputs should stay available for that session.

### Is there a subscription?

No. You pay only when you unlock a generated result.
