# Video Generation

Video generation is available **after you reveal a caption**. It’s triggered from the revealed caption screen via **Generate video**.

Each click generates **one** video. Each generation costs **1 credit**.

### Flow

1. Reveal a caption (costs **1 credit**).
2. Tap **Generate video**.
3. (Optional) tweak the prompt or select a style.
4. Wait for the video to render.
5. The video is shown on the result screen.

Generating the video costs **1 credit**.

### Recommended defaults

Keep defaults simple. These work well for social posts:

* Duration: **5–10s**
* Format: **vertical**
* Captions on video: **on** (optional)

### After generation

After generation, you can:

* Save the video.
* Post it through the Base compose flow.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Video renders can take longer. Show progress states. Don’t spend a credit until the final video is ready to reveal.
{% endhint %}
