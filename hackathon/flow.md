# Flow

### 🎯 Hackathon Success Criteria

This project is designed to meet the highest standards of the Base ecosystem:

1. ✅ **Demoable in <60 seconds**: The user journey from wallet connection to generating a viral post is engineered for maximum speed and retention.
2. ✅ **Defensible Architecture**: Our hybrid Onchain-Offchain model is built to stand up to technical scrutiny during judge Q\&A sessions.
3. ✅ **Understandable Flow**: Both judges and creators can grasp the core value proposition of HookLab AI instantly upon first use.
4. ✅ **Alignment with Base Ecosystem Goals**:
   * **Onchain Value**: Real-world subscription revenue processed directly on the Base network.
   * **Social Engagement**: Deep, native integration with the Farcaster protocol via Neynar indexing.
   * **Creator Monetization**: Opening new, sustainable income paths for creators on top of the blockchain.
